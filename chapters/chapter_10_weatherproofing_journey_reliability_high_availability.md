# Chapter 10: Weatherproofing the Journey: Reliability/High Availability

In this section, we delve into the crucial aspects of reliability and high availability, which are essential for any production system, particularly AI solutions utilizing large language models (LLMs). We will provide resources and best practices for building resilient AI systems, focusing on strategies to enhance system availability. This includes exploring effective methods for load balancing requests, implementing failover mechanisms to healthy instances, and establishing robust recovery protocols from failures. Our goal is to equip you with the knowledge and tools necessary to ensure your AI systems are not only reliable but also consistently available, thereby optimizing their performance and utility in real-world applications.

## Importance of building resilient AI solutions

When developing production AI solutions for your customers, it is essential to ensure that the system is able to handle high volumes of requests, staying resilient to failures and maintaining high availability, whether anticipated or unexpected. This is critical to ensuring your commitment to service level agreements (SLAs) that you may have agreed.

[Considerations for resiliency](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/well-architected/reliability/principles) should be made as early as possible in the development of a production AI solution to ensure that you are building a trusted AI system. When making these considerations, avoid over-engineering your architecture to reduce the chances of leading to a brittle, less maintainable system. Instead, focus on building a robust system that is able to handle failures gracefully and recover quickly.

### Useful examples for load balancing requests to Azure AI services

- **Load Balancing Azure OpenAI Service with Azure API Management**: If you are developing a production AI solution using Azure OpenAI and need to optimize for high availability and reliability, you may want to use multiple Azure OpenAI instances across multiple regions. However, managing and distributing the requests to a pool of Azure OpenAI instances can be a challenge. The [Azure OpenAI Service Load Balancing with Azure API Management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/samples/azure-samples/azure-openai-apim-load-balancing/azure-openai-service-load-balancing-with-azure-api-management/) code sample demonstrates how to use Azure API Management to simplify this process using load balancing policies with automated infrastructure-as-code deployments. Azure API Management provides a centralized point of control for all your Azure OpenAI instances. You can use it to manage access policies, monitor usage, and apply rate limits to applications using your service. Taking advantage of round-robin load balancing techniques, you can distribute requests across multi-region deployments of Azure OpenAI to optimize for performance and throughput. You can also use API Management to cache responses and optimize for latency. As well as load balancing, Azure API Management provides resiliency in your AI solutions without additional application code. You can easily apply retry policies, handle errors gracefully, and failover to healthy instances ensuring high availability.
