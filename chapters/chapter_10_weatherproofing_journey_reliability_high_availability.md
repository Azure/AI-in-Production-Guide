# Chapter 10: Weatherproofing the Journey: Reliability/High Availability

In this section, we delve into the crucial aspects of reliability and high availability, which are essential for any production system, particularly AI solutions utilizing large language models (LLMs). We will provide resources and best practices for building resilient AI systems, focusing on strategies to enhance system availability. This includes exploring effective methods for load balancing requests, implementing failover mechanisms to healthy instances, and establishing robust recovery protocols from failures. Our goal is to equip you with the knowledge and tools necessary to ensure your AI systems are not only reliable but also consistently available, thereby optimizing their performance and utility in real-world applications.

## Load Balancing multi-region Azure OpenAI Instances with Azure API Management

If you are developing a production AI solution using Azure OpenAI and need to optimize for high availability and reliability, you may want to use multiple Azure OpenAI instances across multiple regions. However, managing and distributing the requests to a pool of Azure OpenAI instances can be a challenge. In this article and code sample, we show you how to use Azure API Management to simplify this process using load balancing policies with a straight forward Bicep template deployment.

The benefits of adopting this approach include:

- **Operational excellence**: Azure API Management provides a centralized point of control for all your Azure OpenAI instances. You can use Azure API Management to manage access policies, monitor usage, and apply rate limits to applications using your service.
- **Performance efficiency**: Taking advantage of round-robin load balancing techniques in Azure API Management, you can distribute requests across multi-region deployments of Azure OpenAI to optimize for performance and throughput. You can also use Azure API Management to cache responses and optimize for latency.
- **Reliability**: As well as load balancing, Azure API Management provides resiliency in your AI solutions without additional application code. You can easily apply retry policies, handle errors gracefully, and failover to healthy instances ensuring high availability.
