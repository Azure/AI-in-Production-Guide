### Strategies for high-volume token usage with Azure OpenAI

In the rapidly evolving landscape of AI solutions, engineering teams face the challenge of scaling and managing model quotas within Azure OpenAI. This is amplified with the need to optimize token usage for multi-tenant SaaS applications that will see high volumes of requests. 

Explore [strategies for optimizing high-volume token usage with Azure OpenAI](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/fasttrack-for-azure/strategies-for-optimizing-high-volume-token-usage-with-azure/ba-p/4007751) for a comprehensive guide to harness the full potential of Azure OpenAI Service to build robust, scalable, and cost-effective AI solutions that meet the demands of your customers.

You will learn:

- **How to efficiently utilize tokens**: Explore how to leverage models for different use cases, apply prompt engineering techniques, and use embeddings to provide context and reduce the overall token count without compromising on the quality of the results.
- **Techniques for scaling out Azure OpenAI**: To achieve high throughput and avoid common pitfalls, such as the Noisy Neighbors problem, learn how to scale out with multiple instances of Azure OpenAI to maximize token availability and distribute request load across regions.
