## Understanding Data Management

Data management is the process of ingesting, storing, organizing and maintaining the data created and collected by an organization. Effective data management is a crucial piece of deploying systems that run business applications and provide analytical information to help drive operational decision-making and strategic planning by corporate executives, business managers and other end users. The data management process includes a combination of different functions that collectively aim to make sure the data in corporate systems is accurate, available and accessible. 

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and data strategy are closely intertwined, with AI being a fundamentally data-centric discipline. AI models depend heavily on the quality, diversity, and representativeness of the data they are trained on. Consequently, the effectiveness of AI models is directly tied to how well the data is managed, making a well-defined data strategy crucial. This strategy ensures that data is clean, integrated, and well-governed, which are key factors in the successful application of AI.

However, implementing AI projects without a robust data strategy can lead to a range of challenges, including data privacy concerns, siloed data, and difficulties in integrating data. AI can also contribute positively to data strategy by automating data management tasks, thereby improving data quality. To maximize the benefits of AI, it's essential that AI initiatives are integrated into the broader data strategy, rather than being treated as independent entities.
