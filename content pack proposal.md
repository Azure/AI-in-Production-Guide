## Performance

### Performance Evaluation Tools for AI Systems

Proposal: Blog Post or Article

Will get an understanding of how to do performance testing of AI applications (load testing, efficiency of the system -latency, stability etc) and also to test performance of the AI model (heart of the application)

### Strategies for Managing High Volume Token Demand

Proposal: Blog Post or Article, Sample code and Scripts

Could be used for reducing cost, reducing latency & improving performance , Quota management in the use cases where high volume of tokens are used.

### Insights into Embedding Upgrades and Version Control in AI

Proposal: Blog Post or Article, Architecture Diagram

 How to adapt to embedding model changes in the following scenarios, which requires recalculation of the embeddings:

1. Azure OpenAI embedding updates:  
    1. input-output dimensions remaining the same but improved models
    1. input-output dimensions also changes with model improvements
1. Customer wants to replace the AOAI embedding models with open-source ones
